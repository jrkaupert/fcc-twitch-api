Freecodecamp.com - FCC Twitch.tv API Front-end project

User Stories:
1. I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
2. I can click the status output and be sent directly to the FCC Twitch.tv channel.
3. If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
4. I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed).  You can see how this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.

FYI - The following array has usernames of people who regularly stream FCC coding: ["freecodecamp", "storbeck", "terakilobyte", "habathcx","RobotCaleb","thomasballinger","noobs2ninjas","beohoff"]
